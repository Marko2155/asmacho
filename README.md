# asmacho
A Mach-O program i wrote in assembly. Very first time i ever used 64-bit registers, ld and syscalls.

# How to compile
## Dependencies
```
ld
nasm
```

## Unix/MacOS or Linux
Run ```./buildUnix``` in the asmacho root directory.
Then the macho64 executable should be in the root directory.

## Windows
Run ```./buildWindows``` in the asmacho root directory.
Then macho64.exe should be in the root directory.
